Here I will seek to establish that Jar Jar Binks, far from being simply 
the bumbling idiot he portrays himself as, is in fact a highly skilled 
force user in terms of martial ability and mind control.
Furthermore, I assert that he was not, as many people assume,
 just an unwitting political tool manipulated by Palpatine-- rather, he 
 and Palpatine were likely in collaboration from the very beginning, and it's 
 entirely possible that Palpatine was a subordinate underling to Binks throughout
 both trilogies. And finally, given the above, I will conclude with an argument
 as to why I believe it is not only possible, but plausible that Jar Jar will make 
 a profound impact on the upcoming movies, and what his role may be.

So here's Jar Jar nonchalantly executing a standing 20 foot twisting somersault.
Now, taken out of context, if you were watching a Star Wars movie and saw a character 
casually execute this maneuver, you'd probably assume it was a Jedi. In the context 
of Jar Jar, though, we don't... because elsewhere he so thoroughly convinces us that
 he's nothing more than a harmless dunce with his inane dialogue and cowardly-lion act.
He also manages to convince us that he's a bumbling oaf in the midst of pitched
 battle... even though he's always incredibly, amazingly successful. Whether single-handedly 
 taking down a battledroid tank, or unleashing a barrage of boombas on their front lines, 
 or precisely targeting multiple enemies with a blaster tangled around his ankle (!!!), 
 we simply roll our eyes and attribute it to dumb "luck."
