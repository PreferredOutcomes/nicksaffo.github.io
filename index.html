				<h3>Bio</h3>
				<img src="images/aboutme.JPG" alt="Me" style=" center; width:100%;">
				<br><br>
					<p>	Hi my name is Nicolas Saffo but I usually just go by Nick. I am 28 years old, well at least I was when I created this page.I recently graduated the University 
					of North Carolina at  Wilmington with a Bachelors in Information Tech as-well-as a Minor in Cyber Security. I grew up in Wilmington North Carolina where I still 
					reside but hope to be able to move somewhere else soon. 
					</p>
					<p>	I enjoy doing things that envolve a level of skill, technique, and problem solving to accomplish. I am a competitive person by nature and always like to do the
					best I can in work or play that reflects me. I play sports like Golf and Tennis from time to time. I also like the simpler things in life such as a hot cup of coffee
					in the morning, the sound of rain, deep conversations and a nice late night drive while there is no one on the roads.
					</p>
					<p>If you know me you know that I have always been a gamer. I have played videogames of many different types and genres. I have played so many good games and
					believe that I have like 20 games tied for 5th place but here is my top 5 list.   
					</p>
						<ol>
						<li>Souls Games/ Elden Ring</li>
						<li>Fallout 4</li>
						<li>Call of Duty DMZ</li>
						<li>Bioshock</li>
						<li>Battlefield 4</li>
						</ol> 
						<p>	I am a decently travelled individual. I have been lucky enough to have the opportunity to visit 8 different countries in Europe and hope to add the that list. Japan is my 
						next destination, it has been high on my bucket list for a while now. This particular picture is from Cabo San Lucas' Lovers Beach.

				<h3>Recently History</h3>
					<p>Right after I graduated, about a year ago. I discovered that I really liked different aspects of digital art. I have always been into games and anime so I looked into
					3D modeling and animation as potential careers. I ended up downloading Blender and teaching myself through various youtube tutorials and videos. I enjoyed making the donut and other basic objects
					but after a while I started to tackle harder things like space ships and rooms with furnature. I made a couple houses for a game called VR Chat. I have also created some pretty cool environment renders like the one. 
					<img src="images/lakemists.png" alt="LakeRender" style=" center; width:100%;">
					Iv'e made cool things from environments to books that open and close, I made a flying machine and an audio visualizer, Iv'e even taken some blueprints to houses and made them. You can check out some of that stuff under the portfolio tab.  
					</p>
					<p>Another hobby of mine that I started to enjoy right around the same time is video editing, or at least some amature version of it. I started making or taking bits of videos or shows that I was watching at the time and editing them with music. 
					I enjoy finally getting the clips arranged in just the right way to the music and it just makes it hit perfect. Sometimes I will come up with cool tricks to do and sometimes the edits just seem to make themselves and fall together. For a while 
					I was just doing edits for shows I was watching which you can find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@beatdank/featured">here</a>. Then I decided to combine this with gaming and created my own gaming channel. It has only been live for 
					about a month or 2 now but I am starting to learn a lot about Youtube. I focus mainly on short form content but I am about to begin streaming as well. You can find that channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ctz0t6y_mUV1XifWoHi6Q">here</a>.
					If you are interested in checking out my editing you can find it in the portfolio tab or just going to either of those channels.
					</p>
					<p>This last one kind of comes with the youtuber territory but I also create thumbnails for my videos. I have been thinking about trying to find work making those to but haven't made any moves on that yet. Examples of those can be found under the Portfolio tab as well.  					
					</p>

				<h3>Goals</h3>
					<p>Goals tend to change as a person moves through life. My goals now at 28 are vastly different from my goals at 21. They adapt to your life experience and maturity. There are a few goals that have presisted with me. The main one being financial independance. 
					Im sure that is one on everyones list. Another goal that has been with me for a while is to find a job or career that matters to me and that I matter to as well. I know that job must exist somewhere in the video game or digital art/media industry. Unfortunatly I 
					realized this after college and have a degree in something different. This is partly the reason I am trying to build up these different skill sets. 
					</p>
					<p>Freedom to travel and visit different geographic locations is another goal of mine. I like to witness history, different cultures and architecture. I also like to just get away once a year. I'd like to get to live in another country for at least 2 years sometime 
					sooner then later in my life. I have never moved outside of Wilmington but I have this itch to do so that gets stronger every year. Im honestly getting to the point where I might just say screw it and move somewhere random. Wilmington is a nice town but I think about it 
					like how people like or don't like snow. Either they grew up with it all their lives and hate it or they hardly ever get snow and they think it's like magic. Magic being living elsewhere. Nothing is that black or white but instead of waiting to move for the company that hires me, I may just need to take it upon myself.
