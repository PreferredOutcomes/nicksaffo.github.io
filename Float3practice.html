	<p>Here I will seek to establish that Jar Jar Binks, far from being simply the bumbling idiot he portrays himself as, is in fact a highly
		skilled force user in terms of martial ability and mind control. Furthermore, I assert that he was not, as many people assume, just an unwitting
		political tool manipulated by Palpatine-- rather, he and Palpatine were likely in collaboration from the very beginning, and it's entirely possible
		that Palpatine was a subordinate underling to Binks throughout both trilogies. And finally, given the above, I will conclude with an argument as to
		why I believe it is not only possible, but plausible that Jar Jar will make a profound impact on the upcoming movies, and what his role may be.</p>

	<p>So first, let's establish Jar Jar as a skilled warrior. While this does not in itself necessitate a connection with the Physical Force, 
		it's highly suggestive in the Star Wars universe-- very rarely do we see "normal" characters exhibiting extraordinary stuntwork or physical
		feats unless they are Jedi, Sith, or at least force sensitives. So here's Jar Jar nonchalantly executing a standing 20 foot twisting somersault.
		Now, taken out of context, if you were watching a Star Wars movie and saw a character casually execute this maneuver, you'd probably assume it was a Jedi.
		In the context of Jar Jar, though, we don't... because elsewhere he so thoroughly convinces us that he's nothing more than a harmless dunce with his inane 
		dialogue and cowardly-lion act.</p>
		
	<p>Now, taken out of context, if you were watching a Star Wars movie and saw a character casually execute this maneuver, you'd probably assume it was a Jedi. 
		In the context of Jar Jar, though, we don't... because elsewhere he so thoroughly convinces us that he's nothing more than a harmless dunce with his inane
		dialogue and cowardly-lion act. He also manages to convince us that he's a bumbling oaf in the midst of pitched battle... even though he's always incredibly, 
		amazingly successful. Whether single-handedly taking down a battledroid tank, or unleashing a barrage of boombas on their front lines, or precisely targeting
		multiple enemies with a blaster tangled around his ankle (!!!), we simply roll our eyes and attribute it to dumb "luck."</p>
