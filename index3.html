				<h3>Star Wars Theory</h3>
					<p>Here I will seek to establish that Jar Jar Binks, far from being simply the bumbling idiot he portrays himself as, 
					is in fact a highly skilled force user in terms of martial ability and mind control.
					Furthermore, I assert that he was not, as many people assume, just an unwitting political tool manipulated by Palpatine-- 
					rather, he and Palpatine were likely in collaboration from the very beginning, and it's entirely possible that Palpatine
					was a subordinate underling to Binks throughout both trilogies.
					And finally, given the above, I will conclude with an argument as to why I believe it is not only possible, but plausible
					that Jar Jar will make a profound impact on the upcoming movies, and what his role may be. So first, let's establish Jar Jar as a skilled warrior. While this does not in itself 
					necessitate a connection with the Physical Force, <img src="images/stardestroyer.jpg" alt="Star Destroyer" style="width:100%;"> it's highly suggestive in the Star Wars universe--
					very rarely do we see "normal" characters exhibiting extraordinary stuntwork or physical feats unless they are Jedi, Sith, or at least force sensitives.
					So here's Jar Jar nonchalantly executing a standing 20 foot twisting somersault.
					Now, taken out of context, if you were watching a Star Wars movie and saw a character casually 
					execute this maneuver, you'd probably assume it was a Jedi. In the context of Jar Jar, though, we don't... 
					because elsewhere he so thoroughly convinces us that he's nothing more than a harmless dunce with his inane 
					dialogue and cowardly-lion act.
					</p>

				<h3><br></h3>
					<p>He also manages to convince us that he's a bumbling oaf in the midst of pitched battle... even though he's always 
					incredibly, amazingly successful. Whether single-handedly taking down a battledroid tank, or unleashing a barrage of boombas 
					on their front lines, or precisely targeting multiple enemies with a blaster tangled around his ankle (!!!), we simply roll our eyes and attribute it to dumb "luck." But is it? Obi-Wan warned us otherwise.
					This is one of the main reasons we as an audience hate Jar Jar so thoroughly; he breaks the fourth wall, he he shatters our suspension of disbelief, because
					we know that no one is really that lucky. We dismiss it as a lame, cliched trope-- the silly pathetic oaf who always seems to inadvertently save the day.
					I posit that, instead, this is a deliberate facade on the part of Jar Jar as a character, and on the part of the writers and animators. As we know, the Jedi 
					themselves are inspired by Shaolin Monks, and there's a particular kung fu discipline that Jar Jar's physicality is purposefully modeled upon which allows him to appear
					goofy and uncoordinated even as he lays waste to his enemies; namely, Zui Quan, or Drunken Fist wushu. This discipline seeks to imitate the "sloshing," seemingly random foibles 
					of a drunkard, but in reality the staggering and stumbling is the use of bodily momentum, deception, and unpredictability intended to lure and confuse opponents.
